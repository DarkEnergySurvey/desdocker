# eeups_empty docker image


This directory contains the files necessary to fully automatically (no user 
interaction necessary when installing eeups) generate a base image only containing
eeups and its prerequisites on top of a **centos7** os.

It can be generated if an appropriate docker installation is present with 
```
$ docker build . --tag=desdm/eeups_empty 
```
being executed from the command line.

There is a read-only svn user for desdm svn repository pre-configured.

To run a container with an interactive bash shell from it use

```
$ docker run -it desdm/eeups_empty /bin/bash -l
```
